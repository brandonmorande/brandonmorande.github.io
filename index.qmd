## About Me

I'm a graduate student in the Department of Sociology at the [University of Washington](https://soc.washington.edu/people/brandon-morande){target="_blank"}. My research broadly examines the relationships between poverty governance, neighborhood change, and placemaking in urban spaces. My current projects specifically investigate the policing of homelessness in Seattle, WA.

I previously worked for a street outreach program in North Carolina, helping people sleeping unsheltered access permanent housing and avoid criminal legal involvement. Prior to this position, I explored peer-based initiatives addressing homelessness around the globe.
