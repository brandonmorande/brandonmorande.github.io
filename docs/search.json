Please find a complete history of my teaching experience below.\n\nTeaching Assistant\n\nUniversity of Washington\n\nSOC 403 Applied Community Research Program, Dr. Anne Tseng, Winter 2025\n\n\n“Description and Resources”\n\n\nStudents collected data on neighborhood and station characteristics that may contribute to perceived and measurable disorder on urban light rail. They piloted methods for other UW researchers and myself to employ in a broader project with Sound Transit.\nIn addition to helping facilitate the course, I led a workshop on gathering and analyzing quantitative data from web searches. The session introduced undergraduates to building and subsetting spatial datasets, downloading Census data, and creating visuals in RStudio.

I will present this paper at the following 2025 conferences: International Society for Justice Research; American Sociological Association; and American Society of Criminology.\n\n\nGraduate Research Student Assistant, University of Washington\nDr. Zack Almquist and Dr. Amy Hagopian\n\n\n“Forced Displacement of People Experiencing Homelessness”\n\n\nThis study evaluates housing outcomes and movement patterns following encampment clearances in Seattle, WA. I presented this work at the Western Society of Criminology 2025 Conference [poster].\n\n\nResearch Assistant, Department of Sociology, University of Washington\nDr. Kyle Crowder and Dr. Charles Lanfear\n\n\n“Patterns of Social Disorder on Public Transit”\n\n\nIn partnership with Sound Transit, this project uses systematic observation and urban-ecological mapping to assess social disorder on Seattle public transportation.\n\n\nResearch Assistant, Department of Sociology, University of Washington\nDr. Drew Messamore\n\n\n“Puget Sound Housing System Study”\n\n\nI am asssisting with compiling property and business data on rental housing ownership in the Puget Sound.\n\n\nStudent Researcher, Department of Sociology, University of Washington\nDr. Nathalie Williams and Dr. Jerald Herting\n\n\n“Sound Data Survey Project”\n\n\nThe research team aims to pioneer a longitudinal survey of the unhoused population in the Puget Sound. I have helped facilitate focus groups with unsheltered participants, as well as analyze data from a pilot survey.\n\n\n\n\n\nPast Studies\n\nHonors Project, Department of Sociology, Bowdoin College | 2018-2019\n\n\n“Salud Callejera: Mobilizing Cuidado at the Margins of Neoliberalism; Reimagining Care for People Experiencing Homelessness in Buenos Aires”\n\n\nBased in Buenos Aires, Argentina, my Honors Thesis analyzes care for people experiencing homelessness as a site for both reproducing and resisting neoliberal governance. This study finds that municipal services and the public health system render individuals responsible for housing insecurity by medicalizing poverty as a symptom of psychosocial illness. As an alternative, civil society networks reimagine care as a collective right and site of political mobilization. In addition to field observations, I draw upon interviews with people experiencing or at risk of homelessness, members of civil society organizations, public health providers, and municipal social workers.\n\n\nIndependent Study Project, School for International Training | 2018\n\n\n“Salud callejera: La Atención Primaria de Salud en los márgenes de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires: Redes de cuidado de una organización de la Sociedad Civil para personas en situación de calle”\n\n\nThis study examines how civil society networks facilitate access to primary care for people experiencing homelessness in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Drawing upon interviews and field observations, I also explore how care differs across state services, civil society networks, and peer groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessional Experience\n\nIndependent Researcher, Washington State Center for Court Research | 2024\n\n\n“Legal Financial Obligations in Washington’s Courts”\n\n\nI helped write a legislative report examining legal financial obligations across Washington courts. The project involved quantitative and text data analysis, stakeholder engagement, and writing for public audiences.\n\n\nThomas J. Watson Fellow, Watson Foundation | 2019-2020\n\n\n“The Street Retold: Stories of Homeless Community Empowerment”\n\n\nThis international project explores how peer-based initiatives empower people confronting homelessness to share experiences, develop solidarity, and help one another survive the streets. I also examine how these communities occupy often inaccessible spaces to change perceptions of homelessness. I documented my observations and interviewees’ stories on Instagram, @thestreetretold.\n\n\n\n\nPlease read this 2025 newsletter by the UW Department of Sociology for more details about my graduate research. You can also find further information about my undergraduate work and Watson Fellowship in this article by Bowdoin College."
