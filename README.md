# Professional Academic Website
### This repository contains the scripts and files for my professional website.

#### The .qmd scripts store the code for the separate webpages:

1. "index.qmd" represents the landing page, which includes my profile photo, bio, and links to my CV, email, and other sites (e.g., LinkedIn, Google Scholar).
2. "research.qmd" provides a description of current and past research projects.
3. "teaching.qmd" lists the courses for which I have served as an instructor or teaching assistant.
