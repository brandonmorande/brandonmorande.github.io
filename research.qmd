### **Past Studies**

-   **Honors Project**, Department of Sociology, Bowdoin College \| *2018-2019*

    <details>

    <summary>"Salud Callejera: Mobilizing Cuidado at the Margins of Neoliberalism; Reimagining Care for People Experiencing Homelessness in Buenos Aires"</summary>

    <p>

    Based in Buenos Aires, Argentina, my [Honors Thesis](https://digitalcommons.bowdoin.edu/honorsprojects/113/){target="_blank"} analyzes care for people experiencing homelessness as a site for both reproducing and resisting neoliberal governance. This study finds that municipal services and the public health system render individuals responsible for housing insecurity by medicalizing poverty as a symptom of psychosocial illness. As an alternative, civil society networks reimagine care as a collective right and site of political mobilization. In addition to field observations, I draw upon interviews with people experiencing or at risk of homelessness, members of civil society organizations, public health providers, and municipal social workers.

    <p>

    This [study](https://digitalcollections.sit.edu/isp_collection/2769/){target="_blank"} examines how civil society networks facilitate access to primary care for people experiencing homelessness in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Drawing upon interviews and field observations, I also explore how care differs across state services, civil society networks, and peer groups.

    <summary>"The Street Retold: Stories of Homeless Community Empowerment"</summary>

    <p>

    This international [project](https://fellows.watson.foundation/51/fellows/brandon-morande.html){target="_blank"} explores how peer-based initiatives empower people confronting homelessness to share experiences, develop solidarity, and help one another survive the streets. I also examine how these communities occupy often inaccessible spaces to change perceptions of homelessness. I documented my observations and interviewees' stories on Instagram, [\@thestreetretold](https://www.instagram.com/thestreetretold/){target="_blank"}.
